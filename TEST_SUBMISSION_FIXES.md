# üîß Test Submission & Proctoring Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Submit Button Not Working**
**Problem**: The SUBMIT button wasn't working properly, potentially due to error handling issues.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Added submission state management to prevent double-clicking
- ‚úÖ Added visual feedback (button shows "SUBMITTING..." when processing)
- ‚úÖ Added fallback error handling to prevent users from getting stuck

### 2. **Fullscreen Proctoring Issues**
**Problem**: The fullscreen violation detection and countdown timer weren't working reliably.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed countdown timer race conditions
- ‚úÖ Improved timer cleanup to prevent multiple triggers
- ‚úÖ Added proper state management for violation handling
- ‚úÖ Enhanced auto-submit reliability with setTimeout delays
- ‚úÖ Fixed timer interval clearing to prevent memory leaks

### 3. **Auto-Submit Countdown**
**Problem**: The countdown timer in the "Return to Full Screen" modal wasn't working properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed interval timer logic with proper cleanup
- ‚úÖ Added immediate timer clearing when countdown reaches zero
- ‚úÖ Improved state updates to prevent timer conflicts
- ‚úÖ Added backup timeout mechanism for reliability

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### **Submit Button**
1. Click SUBMIT button
2. Button shows "SUBMITTING..." and becomes disabled
3. Test data is processed and saved to Firestore
4. User is redirected to results page
5. If error occurs, user gets clear feedback

### **Fullscreen Proctoring**
1. Test starts in fullscreen mode
2. If user exits fullscreen: violation modal appears
3. Countdown timer starts (default: 10 seconds)
4. Timer counts down visually: 10, 9, 8, 7...
5. If user returns to fullscreen: violation ends, strike recorded
6. If countdown reaches 0: test auto-submits immediately
7. After 3 violations: next exit triggers immediate submission

### **Violation Tracking**
- Visual strike indicators (dots) show violation count
- Final warning appears after reaching strike limit
- Clear messaging about consequences

## üîç Technical Details

### **MockAttempt.tsx Changes**
```typescript
// Added submission state
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// Enhanced submit function with error handling
const handleSubmitTest = async (isViolation: boolean = false) => {
  if (isSubmitting) return; // Prevent double-submission
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  
  try {
    // Process and save test data
    await setDoc(doc(collection(db, 'users', uid, 'mockTestAttempts'), attemptId), payload);
    navigate(`/mock-tests/result/${attemptId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting test:', error);
    setIsSubmitting(false);
    alert('There was an error submitting your test. Please contact support.');
  }
};
```

### **TestGuard.tsx Changes**
```typescript
// Improved countdown timer with proper cleanup
intervalRef.current = window.setInterval(() => {
  setViolation((prevViolation) => {
    const newRemaining = prevViolation.remaining - 1;
    
    if (newRemaining <= 0) {
      // Clear interval immediately to prevent multiple triggers
      if (intervalRef.current) {
        window.clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
        intervalRef.current = undefined;
      }
      
      // Trigger auto-submit with delay
      setTimeout(() => {
        autoNow(reason + " (timed out)", false);
      }, 50);
      
      return { ...prevViolation, remaining: 0, active: false };
    }
    
    return { ...prevViolation, remaining: newRemaining };
  });
}, 1000);
```

## üß™ Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Submit Button**: 
   - Click SUBMIT button
   - Verify button shows "SUBMITTING..." 
   - Verify navigation to results page

2. **Fullscreen Proctoring**:
   - Start a test (should enter fullscreen)
   - Press ESC to exit fullscreen
   - Verify violation modal appears with countdown
   - Watch countdown timer: 10, 9, 8, 7...
   - Either return to fullscreen or let it reach 0

3. **Multiple Violations**:
   - Exit fullscreen 3 times (return each time)
   - On 4th exit, should immediately submit

## üìù Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- Enhanced error handling prevents users from getting stuck
- Comprehensive logging helps with debugging
- Visual feedback improves user experience
- Proctoring system is now more reliable and consistent

The test submission and proctoring systems should now work correctly! üéâ
